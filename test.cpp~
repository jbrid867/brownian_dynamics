/* SOME PSUEDO

for the move-resolve-update stage

- move serially (possibly randomize the order)
- individually:
-- check for collisions, resolve
--- use NN list -> access other proteins in brownsys -> return their coords
--- check if there are collisions and which happened first
--- resolve earliest
--- if main, check for exit or reaction
--- check both particles involved (priority to main) for secondary collisions
--- resolve and repeat until dt -> h
-- check for periodic BCs, resolve
-- update coordinates for all
-- move on to next
